# jQuery-tutorials
A repository for my study of jQuery

## Tutorials

Initially I'm using: [learn.jquery.com](http://learn.jquery.com)



## Code base

```
$ cd /Users/factornine/localhosts/www.factornine.co.uk/study/jQuery-tutorials
```

## Projects

Run using webstorm


## Running apps

Best to run using MAMP and navigate to the URL, for instance:

[tutorial-1](http://localhost:8888/www.factornine.co.uk/study/jQuery-tutorials/tutorial-1/)

(Make sure no other local hosts are being run on 8888 first!)


## Bower

The top level has the bower package and can be used to import modules etc.
